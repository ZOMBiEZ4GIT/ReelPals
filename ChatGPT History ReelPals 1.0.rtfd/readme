# ReelPals - Movie Search App

## Overview

ReelPals is a SwiftUI-based movie search app that allows users to search for movies and view details about them. This README provides an overview of the project's structure and functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **ReelPalsApp.swift**: The main entry point of the app, defining the app's structure and navigation.

- **ContentView.swift**: The main content view containing a TabView for navigating between screens.

- **SubmissionScreen.swift**: The screen where users can submit movie search queries.

- **Model/Film.swift**: Defines the `Film` struct used to represent movie data.

- **Utilities/AsyncImageLoader.swift**: A utility for loading images asynchronously.

- **Utilities/PersistenceController.swift**: A utility for Core Data persistence (not used in this version).

- **Utilities/NetworkError.swift**: Defines custom network error types (not used in this version).

## Functionality

### Submission Screen

- Users can enter a movie or TV show title in the search field.
- They can press the "Search" button or press Enter to initiate a search.
- Movie search results are displayed, including movie posters, titles, and overviews.
- Results are sorted by popularity by making an API call.

## IMDB API Migration (In Progress)

Please note that the app is currently in the process of migrating from the original movie API to the IMDB API. Here are some important points to consider:

- The project has been cloned to create a new version specifically for the IMDB API.

- The original project and the IMDB API project share a similar structure.

- The "SubmissionScreen" and "Film" model have been updated to accommodate the IMDB API.

- The API endpoints and keys have been adjusted to work with IMDB's data.

- The sorting of search results has been updated to use "vote_count" as the sorting parameter.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Build and run the project on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

## Future Enhancements

In the IMDB API version of the app, we plan to include additional features such as:

- Movie details page with information like release date, genres, and more.

- A "View" screen for viewing additional movie details.

- Improved error handling and user feedback.
